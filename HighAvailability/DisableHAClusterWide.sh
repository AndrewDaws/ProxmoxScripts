#
# DisableHAClusterWide.sh
#
# This script disables High Availability (HA) cluster-wide by:
#   1. Removing all HA resources found in the cluster (pvesh /cluster/ha/resources).
#   2. Stopping and disabling the HA services (pve-ha-crm and pve-ha-lrm) on every node.
#
# Usage:
#   ./DisableHAClusterWide.sh
#
# Example:
#   ./DisableHAClusterWide.sh
#
# Notes:
#   - This script can only run on a Proxmox node that is part of a cluster.
#   - This script expects passwordless SSH or valid root credentials for all nodes.
#   - Once completed, no node in the cluster will run HA services, and no HA
#     resource definitions will remain.
